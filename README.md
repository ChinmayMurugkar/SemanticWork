SemanticWork
============
Researchers all over the world everyday have to search through large amounts of
research papers and filter them to choose the right candidate. Ranking these documents
is the easy way to mitigate the efforts and time consumed to filter out the unwanted
papers. Lexical cohesion is the property of the text that we use to find coherence in the
document. This coherence, in turn, can be used to find the semantic relationship
between the query words and the documents. We present SDPR: an efficient search
framework for ranking research papers. Three significant features characterize this
system. First, classifying the words according to their importance in the query. Second,
we weight the semantic distance between query and the document using spread
activation technique in wordnet graph based ontology. Third, in order to ensure the
accuracy of the rank, we weight each document based on the term frequency of query
words in them. Results demonstrate a considerable amount of improvement over
traditional keyword-based searching algorithm and helps in query disambiguation.

This Code is still in work. This Application helps rank the documents according to its semantic realationship with the query.
